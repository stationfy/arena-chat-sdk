## Get Started

### Step 1: Install the dependencies

$ yarn
```


### Step 2: Build the project

```sh
$ yarn build
```

### Step 3: Install the example dependencies
From the root directory, you have to change to the example directory (`packages/sdk/examples/react`) again, and then, install the dependencies:
