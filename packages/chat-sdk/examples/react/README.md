## Get Started

### Step 1: Install the dependencies

From the `react` directory, you have to change to the project root directory and install the dependencies using Yarn:

$ cd ../../../../
$ yarn
```


### Step 2: Build the project

```sh
$ yarn build
```

### Step 3: Install the example dependencies
From the root directory, you have to change to the example directory (`packages/sdk/examples/react`) again, and then, install the dependencies:

```sh
$ cd packages/chat-sdk/examples/react
$ yarn
```

### Step 4: Configure the example with your information

Open the `src/App.tsx` file and search for `YOUR_SITE_SLUG` and replace it with your site slug. Then, search for `YOUR_CHAT_SLUG` and replace it with your chat slug.

### Step 5: Run the example
