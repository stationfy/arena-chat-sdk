# Help

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/stationfy/Arena-SDK-Android-demo/issues) as our bug and feature tracker both for code and for other aspects of the library (documentation, the wiki, etc.).
Labels on issues are managed by contributors, you don't have to worry about them. Here's a list of what they mean:

- bug: feature that should work, but doesn't
- enhancement: minor tweak/addition to existing behavior
- feature: new behavior, bigger than enhancement, it gives more bang
- question: no need to modify sdk to fix the issue, usually a usage problem
- duplicate: there's another issue which already covers/tracks this
- wontfix: working as intended, or won't be fixed due to compatibility or other reasons
- non-library: issue is not in the core library code, but rather in documentation, samples, build process, releases
