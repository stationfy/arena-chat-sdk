# Intro

Arena provides a ready-to-use live group chat widget that doesn't require any development effort and it can power many of the common scenarios. For more complex use-cases we made available the Javascript SDK that provides the infra-structure necessary to build your own chat experience and at the same time leverage the powerful moderation and backoffice tools available at the **[Arena Dashboard](https://dashboard.arena.im/)**.

The SDKs are organized inside the `@arena-im/` namespace. It can be used conveniently integrated with any Javascript framework and environment.
